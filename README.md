# Data-Science-Project-Analyzing-English-Premier-League-Team-Performances-

This mini-project was made for the August-September 2025 Kode With Klossy Data Science Project 

API used: https://www.thesportsdb.com/documentation

AI / Outer Sources usage: 

- Asked ChatGPT for key definitions, such as what an API is, and also for examples, such as how to convert a cleaned Data Frame into a CSV file 
- Utilized StackOverflow to see examples on how to drop columns 
- Asked CoPilot to recommend what is the most important to analyze whether a team’s performance is good or not: I used the recommendation to concentrate on League Position (intRank) and Points (intPoints) based on the data available
- CoPilot also recommended using a bar chart of points by team to visualize the data
- Used CoPilot to better analyze datasets, such as helping to identify patterns such as Arsenal’s improvement over the past two seasons, Chelsea’s point fluctuation, and Tottenham consistently ranking four and five
- CoPilot helped in understanding the limitations in my data that I missed 
- Python libraries used: requests and pandas
- Used CoPilot and ChatGPT to understand how to upload my Jupyter notebook into the repository, create .gitignore file, and create config.py to store API key and then to integrate it into my DS_KWK2025_jupyternb.ipynb Jupyter notebook
- Used the tutorial from the website https://medium.com/@t.rosen2101/how-to-create-a-gitignore-file-to-hide-your-api-keys-95b3e6692e41 to create a gitignore file and config.py file for API key
